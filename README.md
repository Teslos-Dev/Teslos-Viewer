# Teslos-Viewer

This viewer started life as a fork of Singularity 1.8.9 (8338). 

See <a href="https://github.com/singularity-viewer/SingularityViewer/releases/tag/sv-1.8.9.8338-release" target="_blank">Singularity</a> for the exact code this viewer is based on.

Please see README-SINGU for the original Sinularity Viewer readme.

Teslos Viewer 1.0.0 is in fact just a renamed and slightly differently configured clone and all relevent urls were changed aswell as the icons.

I intend to use this repo as a place for me to try new things, some of which may be good bad or ugly.

I make no gaurentees for this viewer and as such if anyone decides to use it or code from it then it is down to them to vet it however they see fit.

It is however the viewer I use on the OpenSim platform.
